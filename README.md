# monitoring-workshop-2509

> [!warning]
> This project is still under frequent development and iteration, it is recommended before starting to run `git pull` to ensure code and configurations are up-to-date!

This project contains files to spin up a standalone environment, to get folks familiar with application monitoring.

## Requirements

You will need `docker`, `docker compose` which can be installed via the following:

```
$ brew install colima docker-compose docker docker-buildx
$ export DOCKER_HOST="unix://$HOME/.colima/docker.sock"
$ colima start
```

### Setup

Please run through this setup prior to the workshop & travels (ideally before you get stuck on shared hotel wifi ðŸ˜…).

```
# Start services in detached mode
# We are using '--build' here to let us make changes to the go code on the fly
$ docker-compose up -d --wait --build
[+] Running 16/16
 âœ” example-app                  Built
 âœ” example-app-2                Built
 âœ” Network monitoring-workshop  Created
 âœ” Container gatus              Healthy
 âœ” Container pyroscope          Healthy
 âœ” Container alertmanager       Healthy
 âœ” Container grafana            Healthy
 âœ” Container example-app        Healthy
 âœ” Container loki               Healthy
 âœ” Container tempo              Healthy
 âœ” Container example-app-2      Healthy
 âœ” Container alloy              Healthy
 âœ” Container vmstorage          Healthy
 âœ” Container vmselect           Healthy
 âœ” Container vminsert           Healthy
 âœ” Container vmalert            Healthy
```

If everything shows as `Created`, `Started` or `Healthy`, you are good to go! We can clean this up for now:

```
# Start services in detached mode
$ docker-compose down
[+] Running 14/14
 âœ” Container gatus              Removed
 âœ” Container pyroscope          Removed
 âœ” Container alertmanager       Removed
 âœ” Container grafana            Removed
 âœ” Container example-app        Removed
 âœ” Container loki               Removed
 âœ” Container tempo              Removed
 âœ” Container example-app-2      Removed
 âœ” Container alloy              Removed
 âœ” Container vmstorage          Removed
 âœ” Container vmselect           Removed
 âœ” Container vminsert           Removed
 âœ” Container vmalert            Removed
 âœ” Network monitoring-workshop  Removed
```

### Workshop Setup

If internet permits, please run `git pull` prior to the workshop just to ensure files are up-to-date.

```
docker-compose up -d --wait
```

## Workshop

During the workshop, you may want to make code changes and re-deploy services, to do so, please modify the code in respective directories and re-deploy them via:

```
docker-compose up -d --wait --build
```

### Accessing the services

#### Working Examples (You will mostly work with these apps)

- [store-app](http://localhost:8081)
- [store-api](http://localhost:8080)
- [grafana](http://localhost:3000)
- [vmalert](http://localhost:8880)
- [alertmanager](http://localhost:9093)
- [alloy](http://localhost:12345)
- [gatus](http://localhost:8888)

#### Observability Stack

- [loki](http://localhost:3100)
- [pyroscope](http://localhost:4040)
- [tempo](http://localhost:3200)
- [vmselect](http://localhost:8481)
- [vmstorage](http://localhost:8401)
- [vminsert](http://localhost:8480)

## Cleanup

After the workshop, please spin down services and you can then remove relevant files locally:

```
docker-compose down
```
